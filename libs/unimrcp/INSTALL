BUILD REQUIREMENTS
==================
UniMRCP depends on a number of third party tools and libraries,
which must be installed prior to UniMRCP build.

1. Apache Portable Runtime [>=1.2.x] (http://apr.apache.org/)
Whenever you want to build any part of UniMRCP, you need the
Apache Portable Runtime (APR) and the APR Utility (APR-util)
libraries.

2. Sofia-SIP [>=1.12.6] (http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/)
Sofia-SIP library is used to implement MRCPv2 specification
compliant SIP signaling. Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP User-Agent
library, compliant with the IETF RFC3261 specification.

Use the link below to download one of known to work and 
ready to use packages of APR and Sofia-SIP libraries.

GNU BUILD
===================
Additional requirements
- autoconf 2.57 or newer
- automake
- libtool 1.4 or newer
- gcc
- pkg-config

Build procedure
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Installed directory layout
bin      - binaries (unimrcpserver, unimrcpclient)
conf     - configuration files
include  - header files
libs     - shared (convenient) libraries
plugins  - run-time loadable modules

There are a couple of options to "./configure".
To specify where to look for the APR and APR-util libraries
use the "--with-apr=" and "--with-apr-util=" options.
For example
$ ./configure --with-apr=/usr/local/apr \
              --with-apr-util=/usr/local/apr

To specify  where to look for the Sofia-SIP library
use the "--with-sofia-sip=" option. 
For example
$ ./configure --with-sofia-sip=/usr/local/sofia-sip

To install the default configuration use
$ make def-conf

To generate doxygen documentation from the sources use
$ make dox

To build distribution tarball use
$ make dist


WINDOWS BUILD
======================
Additional requirements
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2005

One-time pre-build preparation
You may need to adjust the paths for 3-rd party libraries
in appropriate property sheets to match your local installation,
while below are the defaults (build/vsprops).

apr.vsprops
	<UserMacro
		Name="AprDir"
		Value="$(SolutionDir)libs\apr"
	/>
	<UserMacro
		Name="AprUtilDir"
		Value="$(SolutionDir)libs\apr-util"
	/>
	
sofiasip.vsprops
	<UserMacro
		Name="SofiaDir"
		Value="$(SolutionDir)libs\sofia-sip"
	/>

Build procedure
Open unimrcp.sln solution file and build the solution (Build -> Build Solution).

One-time pre-run output directory preparation
Build prepare.vcproj utility project (right click on tools -> prebuild in 
Solution Explorer and select Build from context menu). This is a one-time 
output directory preparation. It copies all the required APR and SofiaSIP 
libraries and the default configuration to the output directory. 

Output directory layout
bin      - binaries (unimrcpserver, unimrcpclient) and all the required dlls
conf     - configuration files
plugins  - run-time loadable modules
