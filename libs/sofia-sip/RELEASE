==============================================

Changes since last release
--------------------------

<changes since last written in freshmeat.net "Changes:" style;
 and in less than 10 lines, written in 3rd person English, with
 complete sentences />

Bugs with BYE handling and event fetch/poll (SUBSCRIBE with Expires: 0) have
been fixed in nua. Bugs with timer handling, RFC2543 dialog/transaction
matching and gray list handling have been fixed in nta, all introduced by
release 1.12.8.

Stack now supports some load control with NTATAG_MAX_PROCEEDING(), limiting
number of initial INVITE transactions being served concurrently.

Bugs in blaa and foo have been fixed. The stack now supports
use of foobar...

API/ABI changes and versioning
------------------------------

<see previous release notes at
 http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/relnotes/ for examples ;
 - should include all changes to public headers, and 
   other important information to developers; 
 - and should be updated _continuously_! />

**template**: New features in API are marked with Doxytag macro @VERSION_1_XX_X.

libsofia-sip-ua:
- Added nta_outgoing_bind() to <sofia-sip/nta.h>.
- Allow changing TPTAG_LOG() and TPTAG_DUMP() values after tport_create()
- Added NUTAG_SHUTDOWN_EVENTS(). If NUTAG_SHUTDOWN_EVENTS(1) nua setting is
  used, nua sends events to application normally during shutdown, too.
- Added NUTAG_SUB_EXPIRES() - default expiration time of subscription
- Added NTATAG_MAX_PROCEEDING() - limit number of requests accepted in 
  proceeding queue.
- Using NUTAG_PROXY()/NTATAG_DEFAULT_PROXY() as handle-specific tag. 
  Previously, NUTAG_PROXY() was ignored if given with nua_set_hparams(),
  nua_invite(), nua_respond(), etc.
- Added nua_handle_by_call_id(), nta_leg_by_call_id().
- This release is ABI/API compatible with applications linked against 
  any 1.12.x release. However, applications built against this release won't 
  work against an older library. The ABI has been tested with the nua module 
  unit test (test_nua) built against original 1.12.0 release.

libsofia-sip-ua-glib:
- No ABI/API changes, compatible with 1.12.0. Note, libsofia-sip-ua-glib
  interface is not considered stable and may change in a future 1.12.x
  release.
