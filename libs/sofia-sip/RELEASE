API/ABI changes and versioning
------------------------------

<see previous release notes at
 http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/relnotes/ for examples ;
 - should include all changes to public headers, and 
   other important information to developers; 
 - and should be updated _continuously_! />

New features in API are marked with Doxytag macro @VERSION_1_12_7.

libsofia-sip-ua:
- Added access point selection functionality for Open C / Symbian
- Removed extra system headers from <sofia-sip/stun_common.h>
- Added global variable su_socket_blocking. If it is set to true,
  sockets are created as blocking.
- Added accessor function nta_outgoing_branch()
- Added SIP headers Alert-Info and Reply-To.
- Added macros SIP_HAVE_XXXX for extra headers, e.g., SIP_HAVE_ALERT_INFO().
- **template**: Added foobar() function (sofia-sip/foobar.h).
- This release is ABI/API compatible with applications linked against 
  any 1.12.x release. However, applications built against this release won't 
  work against an older library. The ABI has been tested with the nua module 
  unit test (test_nua) built against original 1.12.0 release.

libsofia-sip-ua-glib:
- No ABI/API changes, compatible with 1.12.0. Note, libsofia-sip-ua-glib
  interface is not considered stable and may change in a future 1.12.x
  release.
