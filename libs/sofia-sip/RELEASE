API/ABI changes and versioning
------------------------------

<see previous release notes at
 http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/relnotes/ for examples ;
 - should include all changes to public headers, and 
   other important information to developers; 
 - and should be updated _continuously_! />

**template**: New features in API are marked with Doxytag macro @VERSION_1_XX_X.

libsofia-sip-ua:
- **template**: Added foobar() function (sofia-sip/foobar.h).
- Added sip_is_allowed() function and k_bitmap field to the 
  sip_allow_t structure 
- Added SIP header Refer-Sub and related functions
- Added <sofia-sip/sip_extra.h> include file
- Added auc_info() function (sofia-sip/auth_client.h)
- This release is ABI/API compatible with applications linked against 
  any 1.12.x release. However, applications built against this release won't 
  work against an older library. The ABI has been tested with the nua module 
  unit test (test_nua) built against original 1.12.0 release.

libsofia-sip-ua-glib:
- The 'nua-glib' module has been removed from the library and moved
  to a separate package 'sofia-nua-glib'. The remaining library (su-glib) 
  is now considered stable and will be API/ABI compatible with later 
  releases in the 1.12.x series.
- ABI has been modified and applications built against 1.12.4 and earlier 
  releases need to be rebuilt.

Notes on new features

RFC 4488 defines the Refer-Sub header. Its datatypes, related functions and
methods declared in <sofia-sip/sip_extra.h> include file. The Refer-Sub
header structure can be accessed from sip_t structure with sip_refer_sub()
method, e.g.,

  if (sip_refer_sub(sip) && 
      strcasecmp("false", sip_refer_sub(sip)->rs_value) == 0) {
     /* Do not create implicit subscription */ 
  }
