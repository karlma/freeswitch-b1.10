  FileName:     q921.h

  Description:  Contains headers of a Q.921 protocol.

  Note:         This header file is the only include file that should be 
                acessed by users of the Q.921 stack.

  Interface:    The Q.921 stack contains 2 layers. 

                -   One interface layer.
                -   One driver layer.

                The interface layer contains the interface functions required 
                for a layer 2 stack to be able to send and receive messages.

                The driver layer will simply feed bytes into the ship as
                required and queue messages received out from the ship.

                Q921TimeTick        The Q.921 like any other blackbox 
                                    modules contains no thread by it's own
                                    and must therefore be called regularly 
                                    by an external 'thread' to do maintenance
                                    etc.

                Q921Rx32            Receive message from layer 3. Called by
                                    the layer 3 stack to send a message.


				NOTE: The following are not yet implemented

                OnQ921Error         Function called every if an error is 
                                    deteceted.

                OnQ921Log           Function called if logging is active.


                <TODO> Maintenance/Configuration interface
				<TODO> Logging
				<TODO> DL_ message passing to layer 3
				<TODO> Timers
				<TODO> Api commands to tell 921 to stop and start for a trunk
