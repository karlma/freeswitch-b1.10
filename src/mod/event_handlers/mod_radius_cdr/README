=========================================================================================

Currently, this is in it's infancy, and is still being worked on.  It is not
yet enabled by default in building.

Comments, code, patches are always welcome.  :)

=========================================================================================

Pre-reqs:

In order to use this module you will need to have the CVS head of the freeradius-client
library installed.

CVS version as of June 14, 2007 or later will be sufficient.

Instructions on how to retrieve and install this can be found here:

   http://wiki.freeradius.org/Radiusclient

=========================================================================================

Building:

1) Compile and install freeradius-client library.

2) Edit the top-level 'modules.conf'.  Add the following entry:

...
event_handlers/mod_radius_cdr
...

3) Re-run configure ??? ( does this need to be done? )

4) Run make

5) Edit freeswitch configuration

   - Make sure the module is loaded
   - Make sure the module XML config file is included

6) Edit the module config file for your system specifics ( servers, secrets, etc. )
