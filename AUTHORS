The PRIMARY AUTHORS are (and/or have been):

And here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, and generally made Freeswitch
that much better:

 Brian K. West - For countless hours of work on BSD and Mac support, finding countless bugs, 
  and moral support.  Xcode project files.
 Joshua Colp - For his help making mod_exosip possible, and for just being a swell guy!
 Michal "cypromis" Bielicki (michal.bielicki  AT halo2.pl) - Solaris porting, and autotools enhancements.
 James Martelletti <james@nerdc0re.com> - All around cool guy (mod_syslog)
 Johny Kadarisman <jkr888@gmail.com>
 Yossi Neiman of Cartis Solutions, Inc. <freeswitch AT cartissolutions.com>  -  implementation of mod_cdr (perldd, mysql, csv)
 
A big THANK YOU goes to:

Justin Cassidy - Build related cleanups and automatic build setup.
Bret McDanel - Javascript Documentation, constant feedback and input, many other things I am sure I am forgetting.
