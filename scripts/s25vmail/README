This directory contains software used for interfacing the
FreeSWITCH voicemail application with the AT&T (aka Lucent
aka Avaya) System 25 PBX.  It's possible that System 75
and Definity PBXs may also work.

s25vmail.js goes into the FreeSWITCH scripts directory.
s25vmail_mwi.c should be compiled and the resulting binary
put into the FreeSWITCH bin directory.  Modify the FreeSWITCH
rc.d script to also start / stop s25vmail_mwi.

Configuration fragments look something like:

  conf/openzap.conf:

    [span zt]
    ; A204DX
    name => OpenZAP
    dtmf_hangup = ##99

    number => 551
    fxo-channel => 49

    number => 552
    fxo-channel => 50

    number => 553
    fxo-channel => 51

    number => 554
    fxo-channel => 52

  conf/dialplan/default.xml

    <extension name="system25_vmail">
      <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(55[1-4])$">
        <action application="javascript" data="s25vmail.js"/>
      </condition>
    </extension>

Tested using FreeSWITCH SVN 10428 running on FreeBSD 6.3
with a Sangoma A200DX Analog Series w/ Echo Cancellation
ports card containing 2 FXO modules.
