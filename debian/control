Description: The FreeSWITCH open source telephony platform
 FreeSWITCH is an open source telephony platform designed to facilitate the
 creation of voice and chat driven products scaling from a soft-phone up to
 a soft-switch.  It can be used as a simple switching engine, a media gateway
 or a media server to host IVR applications using simple scripts or XML to
 control the callflow.
