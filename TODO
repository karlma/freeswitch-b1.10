1. switch.h: Find a good home for the SWITCH_DECLARE stuff for win32
2. MOD_WOOMERACHAN: #if 1==0 sectiton, convert to use switch_now instead of gettimeof day 
				SWITCH_SLEEP (should I be using switch_sleep or switch_yield where I changed from sleep and usleep)
3. if we don't need the timeval stuff let's get rid of it... it doesn't appear to be used.
