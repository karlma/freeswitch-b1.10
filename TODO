1. MOD_PLAYBACK: Convert to use APR files, remove all the WIN32 ifdefs for file stuff.
2. switch.h: Find a good home for the SWITCH_DECLARE stuff for win32
3. MOD_WOOMERACHAN: #if 1==0 sectiton, convert to use switch_now instead of gettimeof day 
				SWITCH_SLEEP (should I be using switch_sleep or switch_yield where I changed from sleep and usleep)
4. all // comented headers and code, cleanup\remove after verifying everything works happy on other platforms
5. if we don't need the timeval stuff let's get rid of it... it doesn't appear to be used.
6. Decide if we are going to keep the libraries in tree or if we build a system that downloads (and patches if necessary) 
7. Exclude .ilk files from loading as modules (they are built when building debug builds and greatly increase the speed of re-linking the lib on a recompile)... 
		it is necessary if we want to be able to debug from the gui.  It can be #ifdef WIN32'd if you like.
